Oi! I am allanger and this is personal blog. 

Here you will find articles about **music**, **development**, **languages**, and a lot of other stuff. I will post everything that seems somehow interesting to me. 

This site is built with **Hexo** but I hope that one day I will rewrite it into **Rust**.

If you have any questions and anything to say, feel free to write me an [email](mailto:allanger@zohomail.com)

## I also can help you with some stuff. Feel free to reach me in case you need
  - A help with devops related things. I will probably help you for some donation or maybe even without it. Let's see
  - A help with mixing your track, I can help you to. Currently, if I like what you're doing, I won't ask any money for it. And I will be working with your track until you're happy with it. Just send me an [email](mailto:allanger@zohomail.com).
  - A beat or an arrangement. I have some beats published on [beatstars](https://beatsstars.com/allanger). But there are many that are ready and not published and even more drafts that I can finish you happen to like the vibe. Or I can create an arrangement from scratch.

## Languages.

I am from Russia, so my first language is Russian. I was learning French and English in school, but my whole life, I was denying French completely.

After moving to Germany, I've realized that it's a pretty good idea to remember French and learn German (especially learn German, because it's a shame to live in a county without knowing the local language). But for some reason, I've decided to learn Spanish and Norwegian in addition to all languages above. I've created a site with [MkDocs](mkdocs.org/) where I'm describing, how I am doing it. I'm not sure that it can be helpful at all, but maybe... You can find it [here](https://languages.fluentbeat.online)
