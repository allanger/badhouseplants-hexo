Oi! I am allanger and this is personal blog. 

Here you will find articles about **music**, **development**, **languages**, and a lot of other stuff. I will post everything that seems somehow interesting to me. 

This site is built with **Hexo** but I hope that one day I will rewrite it into **Rust**.

If you have any questions and anything to say, feel free to write me an ![email](mailto:allanger@zohomail.com)

Some facts about me: 
  - I am from Russia but currently living in Germany. 
  - I am a devops geek.
  - Also, I'm learning Rust and Go.
  - And am musician and a beatmaker.

I also can help you with some stuff. Feel free to reach me in case you need
  - A help with devops related things. I will probably help you for some donation or maybe even without it. Let's see
  - A help with mixing your track, I can help you to. Currently, if I like what you're doing, I won't ask any money for it. And I will be working with your track until you're happy with it. Just send me an ![email](mailto:allanger@zohomail.com).
  - A beat or an arrangement. I have some beats published on [beatstars](https://beatsstars.com/allanger). But there are many that are ready and not published and even more drafts that I can finish you happen to like the vibe. Or I can create an arrangement from scratch.
