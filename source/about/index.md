Oi! I am allanger and this is personal blog. 

Here you will find articles about **music**, **development**, **languages**, and a lot of other stuff. I will post everything that seems somehow interesting to me. 

This site is built with **Hexo** but I hope that one day I will rewrite it into **Rust**.

If you have any questions and anything to say, feel free to write me an ![email](mailto:allanger@zohomail.com)

Some facts about me: 
  - I am from Russia but currently living in Germany. 
  - I am a devops geek.
  - Also, I'm learning Rust and Go.
  - I am musician and a beatmaker.
