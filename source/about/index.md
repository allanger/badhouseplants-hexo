## About me

**Oi!** I am allanger. This is a place where I'm talking about music. Here you will find articles about music creatation, releases review and some other stuff.

This site is built with **Hexo**, but I hope that one day I will create a normal web application for that.

If you have any questions and anything to say, feel free to write me an [email](mailto:allanger@zohomail.com)

## Ratings

I'm listening to releases and writing little reviews here. In the end of each review I'm evaluating the release basing on these criteria: 
- **Specialty**
How much the release differs from other ones? Where zero means that there is nothing special about this one, but ten means it's very unique and original.
- **Boringness**
Is the release (not) boring? I'm rating on a scale of zero to ten, where 0 is completely boring and 10 - absolutely not.
- **Quality of mixing**
It may be not fair to talk about a quality, it's gotta be more about how much I do like the way of mixing, zero to ten too.
- **Quality of arrangement**
Does the arrangement sounds interesting to me? For example, cool catchy licks,  complicated riffs, sick drum tracks, breaks, drops, rhythmical moves and stuff like that will be here
- **Catchyness**
This seems pretty important to me, that release must contain catchy songs that must get stuck in the head and not stop repeating for as long as possible. 
- **Sound Design**
This is something on the border between mixing and arrangement. This is about cool sounds that are being used in the release.

The other category of rating is lyrics rating. Because I'm not able to rate lyrics if I don't understand the language, and many releases are instrumental, I can't put it in the common rating. It's just won't be fair. So if I understand the language, I will rate lyrics too, but it will be a separated rating
